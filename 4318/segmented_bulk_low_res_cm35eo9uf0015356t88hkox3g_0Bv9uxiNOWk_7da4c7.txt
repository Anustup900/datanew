esk cardigan, side pose, white cropped cardigan with a distinctive artistic design. The garment features a V-neckline and appears to be made of a textured fabric, possibly a knit or woven material. What makes this piece particularly eye-catching is the bold black curvilinear pattern that adorns it - thick, wavy lines that create an abstract, almost modernist design reminiscent of contemporary art or graffiti. The lines flow organically across the fabric, creating a dynamic contrast against the white background. The cardigan is fastened with three metallic buttons that appear to be copper or bronze in color, adding a warm accent to the stark black and white color scheme. The sleeves are full-length, and the overall cut of the garment appears to be slightly boxy or relaxed. This is definitely a statement piece that combines classic cardigan styling with avant-garde design elements, making it both wearable and artistically interesting.
