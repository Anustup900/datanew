esk jacket, is a heavy-duty winter parka from Jack & Jones, shown from multiple angles. The jacket comes in a military olive green color and features a robust, utilitarian design. It has a fur-trimmed hood with what appears to be synthetic fur in a brown/beige tone that frames the hood opening. The parka's most distinctive features are its multiple large cargo pockets on the front - there are four main pockets with flap closures, arranged in a symmetrical pattern. The brand's circular logo patch is prominently displayed on one of the chest pockets. The jacket appears to be well-insulated and padded for warmth, with a substantial thickness to its construction. The closure system includes a full-length zipper front with what looks like a storm flap over it secured by buttons or snaps. The cuffs appear to have adjustable tabs, and the overall cut of the jacket is slightly oversized, typical of winter parkas designed to accommodate layers underneath. The material appears to be a durable, water-resistant fabric with a matte finish, likely designed to withstand harsh winter conditions. The construction shows clean stitching and reinforced seams, suggesting attention to quality and durability. The jacket's length extends below the hips, providing good coverage and protection from cold weather. This parka represents a perfect blend of functional winter wear with contemporary urban styling, suitable for both practical winter use and casual fashion wear.
